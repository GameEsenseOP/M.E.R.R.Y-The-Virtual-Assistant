# M.E.R.R.Y-The-Virtual-Assistant
M.E.R.R.Y is a virtual assistant made with the help of python language, it took me almost half a month to complete it but i added most of my efforts to make this application the best. It have many features such as Opening and Closing files,Doing some special tasks such as searching things on wikipedia, telling jokes and all such common things an AI can do... , besides this, it also works with voice recognition(However i dont recommand it because there are some glitches in it, i will fix them soon).
you need to enable voice recognition manually by going to the Run function in MainThread class and adding the function TaskExecution().
I made this actually only for my personal uses but i think anyone can use it.
This application is still at its very early stages, you need to have python 3.6 , inorder to run this application.
